Our page does not look right. The client asked you to improve it.

## Container

Let's start by improving the appearance of the text. Edit the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the text in the `.container` element to have:

- font-face `serif`,
- text size `20px`,
- the size of line spacing `2em`,
- text color `#555`.

## Titles

Now change the appearance of `<h1>` and `<h2>`  titles as described below:

- font face `sans-serif`,
- text written in uppercase,
- letter size: `2.5em`,
- text color: `brown`,
- letter thickness: `normal`.

## Quotes

The last thing you're going to change will be the `<cite>` element:

- background color `#eee`,
- text in cursive,
- text color `#777`.
